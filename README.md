##  **[Power BI: Data Professional Survey Breakdown Project](https://github.com/nhuxhuynh/Power-BI-Data-Professional-Survey-Breakdown-Project.git)**

In this Power Bi, I used a dataset of all professional survey takers in 2022 gathering data about their career, ratings, and other personal informations. 

- Analyzed data taken from the 2022 Data Professional Survey Breakdown dataset
- Utilized Power BI to create a dashboard of visualizations, charts, and tables to report and share data on (technical) careers and their ratings
- Managed dataset by removing unnecessary columns and fixing any errors
- Designed a themed dashboard to tell a "story" of the data by including visualizations to display the important elements of the dataset
- Showcased the insights and data collected to display visualizations of different countries, genders/sex, job titles, salary, work/life balance, etc.
